                  The region around Coimbatore was ruled by the Cheras during the Sangam period between the 1st and the 4th centuries CE
                   and it served as the eastern entrance to the Palakkad Gap, the principal trade route between the west coast and Tamil Nadu.
                   Coimbatore was located along the ancient trade route Rajakesari Peruvazhi that extended from Muziris to Arikamedu in South India. 
                  The medieval Cholas conquered the Kongu Nadu in the 10th century CE.  In the later part of the 18th century, the Coimbatore region
                   came under the Kingdom of Mysore and following the defeat of Tipu Sultan in the Anglo-Mysore
                    Wars,  The Coimbatore region played a prominent role in the Second Poligar War (1801) when it was the area of operations of Dheeran Chinnamalai..

                  Coimbatore is also famous for foundry and automobile industries, manufacturing of textile industry equipment's, 
                  spares, motor pump sets, wet grinders and varied engineering goods and services. 
                  The development of Hydro electricity from the Pykara Falls in the 1930 led to a cotton boom in Coimbatore.
                  The best time to visit Coimbatore is from September to March. Coimbatore receives heavy rainfall during monsoons while summers are a little hot and humid.
                   Hence, winters and late monsoons are a good time to visit Coimbatore when the weather is pleasant.
